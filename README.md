# fm-framework

This framework developed for your small projects or small microservices apps. (if you want use for your big projects, it will not trouble you when used). This framework only offers you structure of middleware you will improve by adding another libraries. for example you can make web application by adding jetty(or another embedding server). I don't like big framework because they add all things I need or not need and this situation be back as complexity and slowness. so I developed this framework and I offers you for can use. if you have suggestion, I can evaluate it all time. Please you send me what is your suggestion or you can send merge request after developed it. My basic rule is  it must simple and plain, it should not include another dependencies. 

As my friend said if you need to comment, the code is mistake :) the code should be readable
